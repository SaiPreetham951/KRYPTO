The AUTH file has the code for JWT authentication which generates a JWT token when logged in or new user can register and then login

Main.py has all functionalities Like Creating alerts, alert history, deleting Alters
These api returns Data in JSON format

I have used cloud Mongo DB to host the DB so it will be handy for others to test

There are few errors due to time consstraints i did not debug it
